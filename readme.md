# Katrinka Swenson's Portfolio

## Project

This is a portfolio of all of my projects, both through coursework and freelance projects. It is [live](https://kjswenso.github.io/portfolio/) on github at https://kjswenso.github.io/portfolio/

## Motivation

This was a project of love using HTML and CSS. It was my first project to learn the basics of responsive web design, including flexbox and responsive images. This will be updated regularly as I amass more projects and learn more technical knowledge.

## Languages Used
- HTML
- CSS
